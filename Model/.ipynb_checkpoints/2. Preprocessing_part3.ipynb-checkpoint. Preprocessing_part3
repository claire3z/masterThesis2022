promotional and selling costs incurred in the second quarter and first six months of 2020 attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as incremental costs associated with establishing Organon as a standalone company., Operating Results Sales Overview U.S. plus international may not equal total due to rounding ., The increase is primarily due to higher sales of women’s health products, including Nexplanon/Implanon NXT, Follistim AQ (follitropin beta injection) and Ganirelix Acetate Injection, as well as higher sales of biosimilar products resulting from the continued uptake of Renflexis (infliximab-abda) in the United States and the uptake of Aybintio (bevacizumab) in the European Union (\"EU\")., The sales increase was partially offset by ongoing generic competition for cardiovascular products Zetia and Vytorin (ezetimibe and simvastatin) mainly in Japan, decline in sales due to the volume-based procurement program (the \"VBP\") in China, an expiration of distribution agreement in Korea for Rosuzet in December 2020, and decreased demand for Cozaar/Hyzaar., The decline during the first six months of 2021 primarily reflects decreases across markets due to ongoing generic competition for products within the established brands business, particularly for cardiovascular products Zetia and Vytorin (ezetimibe and simvastatin), lower sales of respiratory products Singulair (montelukast), Dulera and Nasonex, and generic competition for women’s health product, The sales decline was offset by higher sales of women's health products Nexplanon/Implanon NXT, Follistim AQ (follitropin beta injection) and Ganirelix Acetate Injection due to higher demand, and higher sales of biosimilars resulting from the continued uptake of Renflexis mainly in the

sales of Follistim AQ (marketed in most countries outside the United States as Puregon), a fertility treatment, increased 48% and 37% in the second quarter and the first six months of 2021,

treatment, increased 117% in the second quarter of 2021, primarily due to the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe, Canada and China., For the first six months of 2021, sales increased 101% primarily due to increased demand in the United States as well as recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, Europe, Canada and China., Sales in the second quarter and first six months

(ezetimibe and atorvastatin calcium) (marketed outside of the United States), a medicine for lowering LDL cholesterol, increased 5% in the second quarter of 2021 primarily due to volume growth in France and a slight increase in sales in various markets, partially offset by lower demand in Germany due to competition., Sales of  Atozet  declined 2% in the first six months of 2021 due to lower demand in the EU, primarily in Germany and Spain due to competition, coupled with unfavorable pricing, partially offset by a volume increase in France and higher demand in the Asia Pacific region., Sales of  Rosuzet  (ezetimibe and rosuvastatin calcium) (marketed outside of the United States), a medicine for lowering LDL cholesterol, declined 42% and 47% in the second quarter and first six months of 2021, respectively, due to the expiration of a distribution agreement in Korea in December 2020., The decrease in the second quarter is primarily due to a shift in product and channel mix and lower demand in China as well as lower demand as a result of growing generic competition in Japan., The sales decrease in the first six months of 2021 reflects lower demand in the United States, lower demand due to generic competition in Japan and the Asia Pacific region, the effect of the shift in product mix and lower demand in China, and lower sales in Canada as sales in the second quarter of 2020 was higher due to competitor supply shortages., Sales of  Zocor  decreased 21% in the first six months of 2021, primarily due to lower volumes in China due to the VBP impact., Respiratory Worldwide sales of  Singulair , a once-a-day oral medicine for the chronic treatment of asthma and for the relief of symptoms of allergic rhinitis, declined 8% in the second quarter of 2021 primarily due to the lower performance in Japan attributable to generic competition as well as timing of shipments in Japan in the second quarter of 2020, VBP impact in China partially offset by the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.  , Singulair  sales in the first six months of 2021 decreased 22% primarily attributable to the impact of VBP in China, lower volume in Japan due to generic competition as well as the timing of shipments, and ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Asia Pacific region., Sales for the first six months of 2021  -37- also reflect lower demand in Europe and Canada in the beginning of 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic., Global sales of  Nasonex , an inhaled nasal corticosteroid for the treatment of nasal allergy symptoms, increased 6% in the second quarter of 2021 primarily due to higher demand in China and favorable performance in Russia, partially offset by lower sales in the United States due to the impact of COVID-19 pandemic and generic competition in Japan., Global sales of  Nasonex  decreased 21% in the first six months of 2021 primarily driven by lower demand impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic across several markets in the United States, Europe, and Latin America, and generic competition in Japan, partially offset by higher demand in China., Global sales of  Dulera , a combination medicine for the treatment of asthma, increased 34% in the second quarter of 2021 primarily due to favorable discount rates in the United States., For the first six months of 2021, global sales of  Dulera  decreased 26% largely due to significant buy-in in the six months of 2020 related to the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by the favorable discount rates in the United States in the second quarter of 2021., Non-Opioid Pain, Bone and Dermatology Sales of  Arcoxia  (etoricoxib), for the treatment of arthritis and pain, were slightly lower in the second quarter of 2021 primarily due to the impact of VBP in China., Sales of  Arcoxia  for the first six months of 2021 decreased 12% primarily due to the impact of VBP in China and lower demand in the Asia Pacific region attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic., Other Worldwide sales of  Proscar , for the treatment of symptomatic benign prostate enlargement, declined 38% and 32% in the second quarter and first six months of 2021 primarily due to lower performance reflecting the impact of VBP in China., The increase in cost of sales for the second quarter is primarily due to increases in manufacturing costs and certain costs related to tolling arrangements with Merck which were not in place in the second quarter of 2020., Selling, General and Administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 46% and 33% in the second quarter of 2021 and the first six months of 2021, respectively, due to costs incurred to establish Organon as a standalone entity, higher employee related costs, and higher selling and promotional costs., The decline in restructuring costs is due to lower allocated costs from Merck during the second quarter and the first six months of 2021 compared to the comparable periods of 2020., The decrease in net income for both periods reflects an increase in costs and expenses incurred to establish Organon as a standalone entity, partially offset by higher sales due to higher demand for certain of our products across several markets in the second quarter of 2021., The overall increase in working capital of continuing operations was primarily driven by cash funding by Merck in connection with the Separation, offset by an increase in current liabilities with Merck primarily for inventory purchases, as well as increases in employee benefits and payroll.  , Cash provided by operating activities was favorably impacted by an increase in accounts payable, including amounts due to Merck, partially offset by a decline in net income., A discussion of accounting estimates considered critical because of the potential for a significant impact on the financial statements due to the inherent uncertainty in such estimates are disclosed in the Critical Accounting Estimates section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in Organon's Form 10.]</td>\n",

       "      <td>[Operating expenses in the first quarter of 2021 were lower due to the COVID-19 pandemic, primarily driven by lower promotional and selling costs as discussed below., The decline is primarily due to ongoing generic competition for products within the established brands business, particularly for respiratory products Singulair, Dulera and Nasonex, and cardiovascular products Zetia and Vytorin, as well as generic competition for women’s health product NuvaRing., The sales decline was partially offset by revenue resulting from an arrangement for the sale of generic etonogestrel/ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring, higher sales of fertility products Follistim AQ and Orgalutran due to higher demand, and higher sales of biosimilars resulting from the continued uptake of Renflexis mainly in the United States and Aybintio in certain markets in Europe., Health -27- Contraception Worldwide sales of Nexplanon/Implanon NXT, a single-rod subdermal contraceptive implant, declined 6% in the first quarter of 2021, primarily driven by lower demand in the United States and the U.K. attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic and Latin America attributable to tender delays that is expected to recover in the second half of 2021., Worldwide sales of NuvaRing, a vaginal contraceptive product, declined 28% in the first quarter of 2021 due to generic competition in most markets, particularly in the EU and the United States., Worldwide sales of Orgalutran, a fertility treatment, increased 85% in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2020 primarily due to increased demand and favorable discount rates in the United States., Sales in the first quarter of 2021 decreased 42% compared to the first quarter of 2020 primarily due to shipments in Brazil in 2020 related to government orders., We recorded sales of $8  -28- million during the first quarter of 2021 with no comparable sales during the first quarter of 2020 due to the approval of Aybintio in the EU in August 2020 and the launch in September 2020., The decline was primarily driven by lower sales of Ezetrol in Japan and Ezetrol and Inegy in the EU., Sales of Atozet (marketed outside of the United States), a medicine for lowering LDL cholesterol, declined 9% in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2020 due to lower demand in the EU, primarily in Germany, coupled with unfavorable pricing, partially offset by higher demand in France and the Asia Pacific region., Sales of Rosuzet (marketed outside of the United States), a medicine for lowering LDL cholesterol, declined 52% in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2020 due to the expiration of a distribution agreement in Korea., Combined global sales of Cozaar, and its companion agent Hyzaar (a combination of Cozaar and hydrochlorothiazide that is marketed in Japan as Preminent), a medicine for the treatment of hypertension, declined 12% in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2020 primarily due to lower demand in the United States and Canada due to generic competition, a slight decrease due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic., Worldwide sales of Zocor, a statin for modifying cholesterol, declined 38% in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2020 primarily due to lower volumes in China due to the VBP impact., Non-Opioid Pain, Bone and Dermatology Sales of  Arcoxia , for the treatment of arthritis and pain, declined 20% in the first quarter of 2021 compared with the first quarter of 2020 primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Asia Pacific region, and lower demand in certain markets in the Middle East and Russia., Other Worldwide sales of Proscar, for the treatment of symptomatic benign prostate enlargement, declined 25% in the first quarter of 2021 compared with the first quarter of 2020 primarily due to lower volumes reflecting the impact of VBP in China., Additionally, the increase in cost of sales reflects increases in direct corporate Organon costs partially offset by decreases in divisional costs across markets driven by lower sales and lower allocated costs., Selling, General and Administrative Selling, general and administrative (\"SG&amp;A\") expenses increased 21% in the first quarter of 2021 due to costs incurred to establish Organon as a standalone entity and higher employee related costs, partially offset by lower selling and promotional costs, as well as lower travel and meeting expenses, due in part to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic., The decline in restructuring costs is due to lower allocated costs from Merck during the first quarter of 2021 as compared to the first quarter of 2020 (see Note 4 to our combined financial statements)., The increase in the effective income tax rate in the first quarter of 2021 as compared to the first quarter of 2020 is primarily due to a change in our global mix of income which was partially offset by the income tax benefit recognized in connection with the conclusion of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) examination of Merck’s 2015-2016 U.S. federal income tax returns., The decrease in net income reflects lower sales in part due to the COVID 19 pandemic in addition to an increase in costs and expenses incurred to establish Organon as a standalone entity., The overall decrease in working capital of continuing operations was primarily due to an increase in related party current liabilities and an increase in accrued employee benefits and payroll., A discussion of accounting estimates

however, due to the aforementioned change in methodology, the change in operating revenues attributed to weather resulted in an increase of $7.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018., This decrease is primarily attributable to warmer weather experienced in 2020 compared to 2019, the sale of the Massachusetts Business and decreased usage by commercial and industrial customers primarily due to the pandemic., The change in operating revenues was primarily driven by: • Lower cost of energy billed to customers, which is offset in operating expense, of $152.1 million., This change was primarily driven by: • Lower cost of energy billed to customers, which is offset in operating revenue, of $152.1 million., Partially offset by: • Increased depreciation of $61.6 million primarily due to additional plant placed in service., Increased expenses primarily due to the impact of pandemic-related materials and supplies, outside services, uncollectible and sequestration expenses of $10.7 million, offset by a $5.3 million deferral of uncollectible and other expenses, related to the pandemic., Increased materials and supplies costs of $4.7 million • Higher insurance expense of $2.7 million primarily driven by increased premiums., The change in operating revenues was primarily driven by: • Lower cost of energy billed to customers, which is offset in operating expense, of $34.8 million., This change was primarily driven by: • Lower cost of energy billed to customers, which is offset in operating revenue, of $34.8 million., Increased depreciation of $8.7 million due to higher capital expenditures placed in service., In general, we calculate the weather-related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating or cooling degree days., This decrease was primarily attributable to decreased usage by industrial and commercial customers due to the pandemic and higher self-generation by industrial customers, partially offset by increased usage by residential customers primarily due to the pandemic., As discussed in the \"Executive Summary\", Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors,” and in Note 20, “Other Commitments and Contingencies” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, due to the inherent uncertainty of litigation, there can be no assurance that the outcome or resolution of any particular claim related to the Greater Lawrence Incident will not continue to have an adverse impact on our cash flows., This decrease was primarily driven by a year over year increase in net payments related to the Greater Lawrence Incident., In 2020, our typical investing cash outflows were offset by $1,115.9 million of proceeds from the sale of assets, driven by the sale of the Massachusetts Business., Flows primarily due to the capitalized portion of the Corporate Incentive Plan payout, inclusion of capital expenditures included in current liabilities and AFUDC Equity.  , This decrease in spending is primarily due to the sale of the Massachusetts Business and impact of COVID 19., This increased spending is primarily due to growth, safety and system modernization projects., Credit risk arises due to the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date.]</td>\n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                [Operating expenses in the first quarter of 2021 were lower due to the COVID-19 pandemic, primarily driven by lower promotional and selling costs as discussed below., The decline is primarily due to ongoing generic competition for products within the established brands business, particularly for respiratory products Singulair, Dulera and Nasonex, and cardiovascular products Zetia and Vytorin, as well as generic competition for women’s health product NuvaRing., The sales decline was partially offset by revenue resulting from an arrangement for the sale of generic etonogestrel/ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring, higher sales of fertility products Follistim AQ and Orgalutran due to higher demand, and higher sales of biosimilars resulting from the continued uptake of Renflexis mainly in the United States and Aybintio in certain markets in Europe., Health -27- Contraception Worldwide sales of Nexplanon/Implanon NXT, a single-rod subdermal contraceptive implant, declined 6% in the first quarter of 2021, primarily driven by lower demand in the United States and the U.K. attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic and Latin America attributable to tender delays that is expected to recover in the second half of 2021., Worldwide sales of NuvaRing, a vaginal contraceptive product, declined 28% in the first quarter of 2021 due to generic competition in most markets, particularly in the EU and the United States., Worldwide sales of Orgalutran, a fertility treatment, increased 85% in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2020 primarily due to increased demand and favorable discount rates in the United States., Sales in the first quarter of 2021 decreased 42% compared to the first quarter of 2020 primarily due to shipments in Brazil in 2020 related to government orders., We recorded sales of $8  -28- million during the first quarter of 2021 with no comparable sales during the first quarter of 2020 due to the approval of Aybintio in the EU in August 2020 and the launch in September 2020., The decline was primarily driven by lower sales of Ezetrol in Japan and Ezetrol and Inegy in the EU., Sales of Atozet (marketed outside of the United States), a medicine for lowering LDL cholesterol, declined 9% in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2020 due to lower demand in the EU, primarily in Germany, coupled with unfavorable pricing, partially offset by higher demand in France and the Asia Pacific region., Sales of Rosuzet (marketed outside of the United States), a medicine for lowering LDL cholesterol, declined 52% in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2020 due to the expiration of a distribution agreement in Korea., Combined global sales of Cozaar, and its companion agent Hyzaar (a combination of Cozaar and hydrochlorothiazide that is marketed in Japan as Preminent), a medicine for the treatment of hypertension, declined 12% in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2020 primarily due to lower demand in the United States and Canada due to generic competition, a slight decrease due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic., Worldwide sales of Zocor, a statin for modifying cholesterol, declined 38% in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2020 primarily due to lower volumes in China due to the VBP impact., Non-Opioid Pain, Bone and Dermatology Sales of  Arcoxia , for the treatment of arthritis and pain, declined 20% in the first quarter of 2021 compared with the first quarter of 2020 primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Asia Pacific region, and lower demand in certain markets in the Middle East and Russia., Other Worldwide sales of Proscar, for the treatment of symptomatic benign prostate enlargement, declined 25% in the first quarter of 2021 compared with the first quarter of 2020 primarily due to lower volumes reflecting the impact of VBP in China., Additionally, the increase in cost of sales reflects increases in direct corporate Organon costs partially offset by decreases in divisional costs across markets driven by lower sales and lower allocated costs., Selling, General and Administrative Selling, general and administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses increased 21% in the first quarter of 2021 due to costs incurred to establish Organon as a standalone entity and higher employee related costs, partially offset by lower selling and promotional costs, as well as lower travel and meeting expenses, due in part to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic., The decline in restructuring costs is due to lower allocated costs from Merck during the first quarter of 2021 as compared to the first quarter of 2020 (see Note 4 to our combined financial statements)., The increase in the effective income tax rate in the first quarter of 2021 as compared to the first quarter of 2020 is primarily due to a change in our global mix of income which was partially offset by the income tax benefit recognized in connection with the conclusion of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) examination of Merck’s 2015-2016 U.S. federal income tax returns., The decrease in net income reflects lower sales in part due to the COVID 19 pandemic in addition to an increase in costs and expenses incurred to establish Organon as a standalone entity., The overall decrease in working capital of continuing operations was primarily due to an increase in related party current liabilities and an increase in accrued employee benefits and payroll., A discussion of accounting estimates considered critical because of the potential for a significant impact on the financial statements due to the inherent uncertainty in such estimates are disclosed in the Critical Accounting Estimates section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the Company's Form 10.]  \n",

revenue related to the sale of the Massachusetts Business, as well as higher operating expenses due to insurance recoveries recorded in 2019, net of third-party claims and other costs, related to the Greater Lawrence Incident., This change is primarily due to the loss on early extinguishment of debt in 2020., These items are offset by increased deferred tax expense recognized on the sale of the Columbia of Massachusetts' regulatory liability, established due to TCJA in 2017, that would have otherwise been recognized over the amortization period, non-cash impairment of goodwill related to Columbia of Massachusetts in 2019 (see Note 7, \"Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\" for additional information) and one-time adjustments to deferred tax balances., The change in operating revenues was primarily driven by: • Lower cost of energy billed to customers, which is offset in operating expense, of $273.4 million., Lower revenues due to the sale of the Massachusetts Business of $102.2 million., This change was primarily driven by: • Loss on sale of the Massachusetts Business of $412.4 million., Increased expenses primarily due to the impact of the pandemic related to materials and supplies, outside services, and uncollectible expenses of $23.8 million, offset by $12.0 million of deferral of uncollectible and other expenses, net of benefits, related to the pandemic., primarily due to higher capital expenditures placed in service of $24.3 million, Lower operation and maintenance and depreciation and amortization expenses due to the Massachusetts Business sale of $98.7 million., The change in operating revenues was primarily driven by: •, This change was primarily driven by: • Decreased expenses related to third-party claims and other costs for the Greater Lawrence Incident of $1,090.7 million, net of insurance recoveries recorded., Increased depreciation of $103.8 million due to the regulatory outcome of NIPSCO's gas rate case, an increase in amortization of depreciation previously deferred as a regulator asset resulting from Columbia of Ohio's CEP, and higher capital expenditures placed in service., Higher employee and administrative expenses of $50.2 million driven by resources shifting from the temporary assistance on the Greater Lawrence Incident restoration to normal operations (offset in the decreased Greater Lawrence Incident costs discussed above) and an increase in headcount.  , Higher property taxes of $22.2 million primarily due to increased amortization of property taxes previously deferred as a regulatory asset resulting from Columbia of Ohio's CEP, as well as higher capital expenditures placed in service., Higher outside services of $17.4 million primarily due to increased line location and safety-related work., In general, we calculate the weather-related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days, net of weather normalization mechanisms., The majority of these amounts were driven by NIPSCO and Columbia of Pennsylvania.  , Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2019 was about 1% warmer than normal and about 3% warmer than 2018; however, due to the aforementioned change in methodology, the change in operating revenues attributed to weather resulted in an increase of $7.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018., This decrease is primarily attributable to warmer weather experienced in 2020 compared to 2019, the sale of the Massachusetts Business and decreased usage by commercial and industrial customers primarily due to the pandemic., The change in operating revenues was primarily driven by: • Lower cost of energy billed to customers, which is offset in operating expense, of $152.1 million., This change was primarily driven by: • Lower cost of energy billed to customers, which is offset in operating revenue, of $152.1 million., Partially offset by: • Increased depreciation of $61.6 million primarily due to additional plant placed in service., Increased expenses primarily due to the impact of pandemic-related materials and supplies, outside services, uncollectible and sequestration expenses of $10.7 million, offset by a $5.3 million deferral of uncollectible and other expenses, related to the pandemic., Increased materials and supplies costs of $4.7 million • Higher insurance expense of $2.7 million primarily driven by increased premiums., The change in operating revenues was primarily driven by: • Lower cost of energy billed to customers, which is offset in operating expense, of $34.8 million., This change was primarily driven by: • Lower cost of energy billed to customers, which is offset in operating revenue, of $34.8 million., Increased depreciation of $8.7 million due to higher capital expenditures placed in service., In general, we calculate the weather-related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating or cooling degree days., This decrease was primarily attributable to decreased usage by industrial and commercial customers due to the pandemic and higher self-generation by industrial customers, partially offset by increased usage by residential customers primarily due to the pandemic., As discussed in the \"Executive Summary\", Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors,” and in Note 20, “Other Commitments and Contingencies” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, due to the inherent uncertainty of litigation, there can be no assurance that the outcome or resolution of any particular claim related to the Greater Lawrence Incident will not continue to have an adverse impact on our cash flows., This decrease was primarily driven by a year over year increase in net payments related to the Greater Lawrence Incident., In 2020, our typical investing cash outflows were offset by $1,115.9 million of proceeds from the sale of assets, driven by the sale of the Massachusetts Business., Flows primarily due to the capitalized portion of the Corporate Incentive Plan payout, inclusion of capital expenditures included in current liabilities and AFUDC Equity.  , This decrease in spending is primarily due to the sale of the Massachusetts Business and impact of COVID 19., This increased spending is primarily due to growth, safety and system modernization projects., Credit risk arises due to the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date.]  \n",
